## Features
### FASTQ Filtering
- Filter FASTQ files based on GC content, sequence length, and quality score.
- Specify custom ranges for GC content and sequence length.
- Set a minimum quality score threshold for sequences.
### FASTA File Manipulation
- Get quick info on each sequence in FASTA file.
- Convert multiline FASTA files to one-line format.
- Shift the start position of one-line FASTA sequences by a specified amount.
### BLAST Output Parsing
- Extract the top hit for each query from BLAST output files.
- Results are sorted alphabetically for easy analysis.
### DNA, RNA & amino acid classes
- Calculates GC content in DNA and RNA sequences
- Prints complement sequence for DNA
- Transcribes DNA sequence to RNA
- Prints RNA sequence in codons
- Finds motifs in nucleic acids sequences
- Translates RNA sequence to amino acid (without biological meaning, it does it "dumbly")
- Calculates molecular weight of amino acid sequence
### Custom RandomForestClassifier
- Self written implementation of RandomForestClassifier
- Has parallelisation functionality (speeds up 2 times when specifying 2 threads)

## Installation
